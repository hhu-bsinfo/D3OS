## Requirements

For building D3OS, a _rust nightly_ toolchain is needed. To install _rust_ use [rustup](https://rustup.rs/). The nightly toolchain (2024-08-22) is confirmed to work.

```
rustup toolchain install nightly
rustup override set nightly
```

To run the build commands _cargo-make_ is required. Install it with:

```
cargo install --no-default-features cargo-make
```

Furthermore, the following packages for Debian/Ubuntu based systems (or their equivalent packages on other distributions) need to be installed:

```
apt install build-essential nasm wget qemu-system-x86_64
```

## Build and Run

To build D3OS and run it in QEMU, just execute: 

```
cargo make --no-workspace
```

To only build the bootable image _d3os.img_, run:

```
cargo make --no-workspace image
```
